PONG is a table tennisâ€“themed twitch arcade sports video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. 



Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The ball bounces off the paddle and two walls. If the ball hits behind the paddle you score a point.
